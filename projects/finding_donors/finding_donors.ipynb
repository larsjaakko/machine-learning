    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The dataset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Decision trees**\n",
    "- **Real world application:** As described [here](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.90.5327&rep=rep1&type=pdf), decision trees can have many useful applications, for instance in characterization of leiomyomatous tumors and predicting library book use. We can also find references of use in [pricing financial instruments](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/financial-theory/11/decisions-trees-finance.asp).\n",
    "- **Strengths:** Decision trees are quite simple in nature, and are easy to visualize, which makes it easier to  understand how the model works. This can be helpful for many business applications, as it can give decision makers additional intuition about the problem space. \n",
    "Also, as mentioned in [various](https://discuss.analyticsvidhya.com/t/how-are-decision-trees-not-sensitive-to-skewed-distributions/2158/2) [forums](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-using-a-decision-tree-for-classification) the decision tree classifiers are less sensitive to skewed data than other methods, for instance SVMs. \n",
    "- **Weaknesses:** Decision trees are prone to overfitting, unless pruned or limited in size. Also [mentioned](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/1292/what-is-the-weak-side-of-decision-trees) is that decision trees may be overly sensitive to small changes in the data, or may have poor out-of-sample predictions, since the decision boundary is non-smooth.\n",
    "- **Problem fit:** The problem faced in this exercise lends itself well to a visual decision tree, as the features and outcome variables are all very understandable/tangible for humans — a decision tree and its logic will be easy to communicate to decision makers. In addition, our dataset is somewhat skewed, which a decision tree should handle nicely. Something like a standard SVM would potentially not be as usable for skewed data, according to [several](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/vasile.palade/papers/Class-Imbalance-SVM.pdf) [sources](https://www.quora.com/For-what-kind-of-classification-problems-is-SVM-a-bad-approach).\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Random forests**\n",
    "I'm including random forests here since they're so related to the decision trees, but should be able to mitigate some of their shortcomings. Should be interesting to see.\n",
    "- **Real world application:** Random forests are used for all kinds of classification (and regression) applications. One example can be [early identification of diabetic retinopathy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062420/), a common cause of blindness. \n",
    "- **Strengths:** Random forests are [simple to train, versatile, accurate](https://medium.com/rants-on-machine-learning/the-unreasonable-effectiveness-of-random-forests-f33c3ce28883), and [should not overfit as much as the single decision trees are prone to](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm).\n",
    "- **Weaknesses:** Random forests unfortunately do not share the visual and intuitive quality as its single-tree brothers, as the algorithm \"hides\" the exact logic for splitting the features. Some mention [random forests being memory intensive if the number of trees is large](https://www.quora.com/When-is-a-random-forest-a-poor-choice-relative-to-other-algorithms). Also of note, there are apparently issues with sklearn's implementation and requirement of one-hot encoding categorical variables, as random forests (and decision trees) [should work better with pure categorical variables](https://roamanalytics.com/2016/10/28/are-categorical-variables-getting-lost-in-your-random-forests/). A fix is [proposed for sklearn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4899), but this is not yet merged — we'll have to live with it for now. \n",
    "- **Problem fit:** Sklearns numerical requirement notwithstanding, the random forest should work well for our problem data. Skewed data should not be a problem. Random forests are not able to predict values outside the range of the dependent variable, which shouldn't be an issue here, since we have a classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Gradient Boosting**\n",
    "To continue with a suite of tree-based classifiers, we'll finish off with gradient boosting. Instead of training trees in parallell, like the above, this method trains trees in sequence; each tree improving on the previous tree.\n",
    "- **Real world application:** Same as the two above, it is used for myriad classification problems. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting#Usage), Gradient Boosting is used by search engines to rank results.  \n",
    "- **Strengths:** Gradient Boosting should work well for the same use cases as the two other methods. \n",
    "- **Weaknesses:** Gradient boosting [can be more resource intensive to train](https://databricks.com/blog/2015/01/21/random-forests-and-boosting-in-mllib.html). Gradient boosted trees are also reportedly [more prone to overfitting](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-disadvantages-of-using-Gradient-Boosting-over-Random-Forests) than random forests, and may require more tuning to generalize well.\n",
    "- **Problem fit:** I have not been able to find many reports or sources that suggest that gradient boosting should not work well with this type of dataset. From what I can find it seems to be very [flexible and robust](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Gradient-boosting-work-so-well-for-so-many-Kaggle-problems). It can struggle when it deals with datasets with a [high number of dimensions and sparse data](http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~chohsieh/rf/icml_sparse_GBDT.pdf), but I do not expect 103 features over 37k samples should be a problem. \n"

    "The model I suggest we choose is the GradientBoost model, as it is the most accurate one across the board — both for a pure accuracy score, but also for the more relevant F-score. GradientBoost has a slightly lower performance when predicting on the training set, but seems to generalize better than the two others. The GradientBoost model should be well suited for the type of data we have, it's flexible and handles skew in stride. Our dimensionality of 103 features does not seem to pose any problems either. \n",
    "\n",
    "We should note that the RandomForest classifier is not very far behind in terms of accuracy, and is trained significantly faster than the GradientBoost classifier. If the final volume of data is very large, the RandomForest classifier may give a better trade-off between speed and accuracy. As it stands, however, a 10 second training time should be fully acceptable."
